// request_permissions read grant to a child safe: the child can audit the granted
// path but cannot modify it. Emitting the grant as a WRITE root (--add-dir) would
// break exactly this.

//
// THE CAUSE, NOT THE SYMPTOM. NewScope seeds the system temporary directory as a
// permanent write root, so a plain t.TempDir() grant is writable before any
// grant exists and the anti-escalation assertions below prove nothing. The first
// fix placed the fixture under os.UserHomeDir() to find ground the defaults do
// not own. That worked and bought two problems: a hermetic runner may expose
// HOME read-only, so these tests failed at MkdirTemp before asserting anything,
// and on an ordinary machine they wrote into the developer's real home and left
// zero-scope-* debris whenever a run was interrupted. Reported by @jatmn.
//
// Building the Scope directly removes the seeded defaults, which is what made
// HOME necessary in the first place. t.TempDir() is then outside by
// construction, the fixture is hermetic, and nothing touches HOME.
