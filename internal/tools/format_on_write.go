// Format-on-write for the mutating file tools. When enabled, a successful
// edit_file/write_file runs the language's standard formatter on the file it
// just wrote, so the model's output always lands in project-canonical style
// and never fails a CI format check it cannot see. Off by default (set
// ZERO_FORMAT_ON_WRITE=1): auto-reformatting changes bytes the model did not
// write, which strict workflows may not want.
//
// Ordering matters: formatting runs BEFORE the FileTracker re-baseline, and
// the caller records the POST-format content. Formatting after the baseline
// would make the very next edit look like an external modification and trip
// the conflict guard.

// formatOnWriteTimeout bounds one formatter run; a wedged formatter must never
// hang a tool call. On timeout the unformatted write stands, and the caller
// says so: see formatOnWriteResult.
//
// A var rather than a const so a test can shorten it. Nothing outside a test
// assigns to it, and the deadline path was previously unreachable in a test at
// any speed, which is part of why it went unnoticed that it reported nothing.

// A TIMEOUT IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF MISS AS THE OTHERS. Every other way this
// falls back is a standing fact about the environment: the toggle is off, the
// extension has no formatter, the binary is not installed. Those are silent on
// purpose, because nothing is wrong and saying so on every write would be
// noise. A deadline firing is different: formatting was configured, available
// and expected, and the file was written unformatted anyway, on a machine that
// was merely slow. Left silent, the caller believes it wrote canonical style
// and finds out from a CI format check it cannot see, which is the thing this
// feature exists to prevent.
